### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Hugh Bromund

#### I'm a Junior studying Computer Science at Purdue University

I'm currently working at LincLogix as a Software Developer Intern. I'm building awesome websites and apps using React, Node, Electron, and Express.

### Want to see some of my work:

- [LincLogix website redesign](https://www.linclogix.com)
  - I was tasked with redesigning the LincLogix website as part of my summer internship. I created a new, modern look that kept the same feel as the original. I also improved the hosting of the website by switching to Google Cloud.
- [FINEX](https://finex.money)
  - FINEX was a team project for CS307 - Intro to Software Engineering. It was created as an easy to use finance and budgeting platform. I created the Visual Design for the site as well as building many of the frontend pages. I also built our automatic testing system and maintain the deployment of the site.
- [hughbromund.com](https://hughbromund.com)
  - As a Personal Project over the summer, I decided to redesign my personal website. Instead of using a template, I built it from the ground up using React. The final site is mobile friendly and responsive.
